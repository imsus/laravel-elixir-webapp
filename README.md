# Laravel Elixir Webapp

> A blazing fast web boilerplate based on Laravel Elixir.

This boilerplate is intended for person who actually comfortable with laravel project. But now I took the laravel-elixir module and make it standalone, so it will be modular and reusable with other projects outside laravel.

**Laravel Elixir Webapp** provides a skeleton for creating a web page.

## Installation

1. Since this boilerplate is a project, not a module. You should clone this project first. On Terminal/bash type this

```bash
git clone https://github.com/imsus/laravel-elixir-webapp.git my-project
```

2. After that, install the dependencies using NPM or Yarn.

If using NPM then type:

```bash
$ npm install
```

or if using Yarn then type:

```bash
$ yarn
```

3. Now you can start develop websites using this project.

## Usage

All tasks are described in the gulpfile.js
Most of the task are documented in [official Laravel Elixir documentation](https://laravel.com/docs/master/elixir).
